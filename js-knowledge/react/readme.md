# React Concepts

### Why React

React helps developers to update the DOM based on the props/states, so that we don't have to manually update DOM elements

### Lifecycle

- Mount
- Update
- Unmount

### Purpose of React Hooks

Hooks is the way to manage the states. Developers can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. useEffect: manage side effects

### Uncontrolled Components

Some components which you don't want to re-render according to its state/value's change e.g. React Ref

There are a few good use cases for refs:

- Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
- Triggering imperative animations.
- Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.
